## The Interactive Interpreter

Open R and type `2 + 2`.  R tells you that the answer is `4`. Congrats!  You are now using R. This is the most basic way to interact with the interpreter.  Later we will see how you can save complicated series of commands to a script file and excecute them automatically. 

## Assignment

Sometimes it is useful to save the results of computations in a named variable that we will use later.  We can create a named variable using the `<-` operator.  For instance, we can do the following.

```{r}
myVariable <- 2 + 2
```

Now the result from this computation is saved for later use.  Later, we can use this  variable like so: 

```{r}
myVariable * myVariable
```
