We will be relying heavily on a piece of software called Rstudio. There are a [ton of reasons](http://www.ancienteco.com/2013/02/top-6-reasons-you-need-to-be-using.html) to use Rstudio.  It includes a lot of time-saving features!  There are four main sections of the screen: 

* **interpreter** - This is R.  Type in a command and it gets executed.  You should use this as your sandbox -- an experimental place to figure out WHAT you want to do, but not necessarily to actually DO what you want to do. 
* **script** - This is where you DO what you want to do.  This is just a regular plain text file with the .R file extension. Scripting is THE REASON to use R.  It provides an exact record of what you did, so that you can recreate each step of the analysis exactly.  
<span class="mega-octicon octicon-alert"></span> Never do something important only in the interpreter: do it in the script, save it, and then send it to the interpreter! <span class="mega-octicon octicon-alert"></span>

* **files/plots/help** - this is where you can see the files in the current project, and where plots appear, and where the help pops up when you type `?plot`.
* **environment/history** - This shows the current variables in memory, and a history of commands executed in the interpreter.  Don't mistake the history for something like a record of your analysis...this will include every command executed, including the mistakes.

## Project Files
I would highly recommend using the "Projects" feature of Rstudio.  This isolates all your files related to a particular projet in a single directory, and it also takes care of setting your working directory: this means you can often avoid typing `/Users/wabarr/Projects/myProject/datafile.txt` and instead just type `datafile.txt`. You can start a project using the RStudio menu (File > New Project).

## R Markdown
This feature is incredible.  Instead of creating regular .R script files, you can create a special type of script file called an R markdown file, which allows you to mix human readable text with snippets of R code. At any point you can "knit" the R Markdown file, which causes the code snippets to be run. Any results (figures or text output) get combined with the human readable parts, and combined into a single pdf, word doc, or html file.  This is how I work mostly....basically writing the methods section of a paper interactively as I write the analysis code. This website is written entirely in Rmarkdown.

### Example R Markdown document

This sentence is just normal text, made for humans to read.  The following bit is a "code chunk", which is set off by the \`\`\` characters and consists of actual R code that gets run, and the results knitted back into the document. You can also put R code inline like this.  What is 2 + 2? The answer is \`&#114; 2 + 2`.

\`\`\`{r examplechunk}<br>
x <- rnorm(100)<br>
y <- (x * 0.3) + rnorm(100, sd=0.2)<br>
plot(x,y,pch=16)<br>
\`\`\`

Here is some more human readable text right after the code chunk.  

### Output of R Markdown after knitting

You can also put R code inline like this.  What is 2 + 2? The answer is `r 2 + 2`.

```{r echo=FALSE}

y <- (x * 0.3) + rnorm(100, sd=0.2)
plot(x,y,pch=16)
```
