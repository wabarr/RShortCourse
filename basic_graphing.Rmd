### <span class="mega-octicon octicon-alert"></span> I am opinionated when it comes to graphics in R. <span class="mega-octicon octicon-alert"></span>

I prefer to not to use the standard graphics facilities in R, which are rather kludgy and take lots of tweaking to make the graphs look great.  Instead, I prefer to use the `ggplot2` package.  You need to install this package using the standard package manager: Tools > Package Manager. Then you will load the packge using the command `library(ggplot2)`.

`ggplot2` provides a convenient function called `qplot()` for making quick plots that don't require a lot of customization. If you need full control over all the gritty details, then you need to learn more about [advanced ggplotting](advanced_graphing.html).  Lets take a crack at `qplot()` first.
